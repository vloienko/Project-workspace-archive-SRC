								<p>Good leaders are incredibly valuable to businesses, and it’s no secret that companies with good
									leadership do better than their competitors. A recent study showed that businesses with bad leadership
									saw up to 42% lower profit margins than their industry peers, while businesses with good leadership
									saw up to 90% higher profit margins. Good leaders are able to make great things happen, and they also
									inspire their team members to do the same. With all of this in mind, how can you become a better
									leader? Try implementing some of these leadership tips in your
									business today!</p>

								<h2>Humanity is part of the new professionalism</h2>
								<p>In today's business world, it's not enough to simply be a great leader — you must also be a good
									human being. Humanity is one of the most important qualities in a leader, and it's something that must
									be nurtured and grown.
									<br> <br>
									Here are five ways to make sure your leadership is on fire:
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<p><strong>Learn about people and develop an understanding of their needs.</strong> The more you
											know about other people, the better you'll be able to provide them with what they need. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><strong>Give feedback that's constructive, not destructive or dismissive.</strong> You may have
											heard if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. Don't follow this advice!
											Constructive feedback can help someone grow, while discouraging feedback can do
											the opposite. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><strong>Show empathy for others' successes and failures.</strong> Too often we take for granted
											that when someone else succeeds, we're failing; when someone else fails, we're succeeding. We
											should show empathy for both because either could happen to us as well.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><strong>Be empathetic in meetings.</strong> Leaders should try to understand where other people
											are coming from by putting themselves in their shoes.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><strong>Have empathy for yourself.</strong> It's easy to want to blame ourselves when things go
											wrong. Remember that mistakes happen, and sometimes those mistakes will be yours. But always
											remember: there is nothing you can't overcome.</p>
									</li>

								</ol>

								<h2>Walking the Walk is more important than ever</h2>
								<p>The world is changing at a rapid pace and the need for effective leaders has never been greater. As a
									leader, it's your responsibility to set the tone for your team and inspire them to be their best. But
									simply talking about what needs to be done isn't enough - you need to walk the walk and lead by
									example.
									<br><br>
									Leaders can't just issue commands and expect people to follow blindly. Every day we make choices that
									define who we are, what we stand for, and how others perceive us as well as how they react to us.
									People will follow if they see that you're serious about your commitments; they'll take the actions
									necessary if they know that the leader cares personally and passionately about their success.
									So before you ask someone to do something, take some time to think about whether or not you would do
									it yourself. When employees experience passion in their work they thrive, feel valued and inspired so
									show them that this work matters by leading with passion!
									Share examples of successes, have fun along the way and encourage feedback to grow as a better leader.

								<h2>Conserving your energy</h2>
								<p>All too often, leaders burn themselves out by trying to do too much. It's important to learn how to
									conserve your energy so that you can be at your best when it's most needed.
									<br><br>
									Here are a few tips:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p><strong>Schedule breaks and get some sleep! </strong></p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><strong>Communicate:</strong> don't try to take on everyone else's problems or take the pressure
											off of yourself. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><strong>Avoid distractions:</strong> keep focused on the goals and tasks at hand, rather than
											getting distracted with other work or issues. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><strong>Keep perspective:</strong> try not to let every little thing become an emergency and
											cause you stress. The future is unpredictable and many things will happen in time; but if you're
											well rested, clear headed, and able to think clearly about the situation then there won't be as
											many surprises along the way.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> If you know something is going to come up in a week or two, make
											sure you have time reserved for it beforehand! You can create calendar alerts or put reminders in
											your inbox so that this issue doesn't suddenly sneak up on you while you're doing something else.
											But even more importantly, plan ahead of time what steps you'll need to take to accomplish your
											task and set aside the appropriate amount of time for each step. Sometimes just thinking through
											all the steps can help reduce any anxiety or stress you might feel before tackling the task.</p>
									</li>
									</li>

								<h2>“Bringing your whole self to work” is the wrong goal</h2>
								<p>When you’re at work, you should feel like you can be yourself. You shouldn’t have to put on a persona
									or pretend to be someone you’re not. Unfortunately, many workplaces are still places where people feel
									like they need to fit in and conform in order to be successful. This is wrong. It’s time for
									workplaces to catch up with the times and start creating cultures that are inclusive of everyone. One
									of the best ways to do this is by ensuring all employees feel safe and comfortable being themselves.
									<br><br>
									If your workplace culture doesn’t support the individual and has them feeling left out, it's important
									to create an environment where people can show their true selves. And if you're in a leadership
									position, it's imperative that you set an example.
									It may seem counterintuitive but instead of focusing on fixing your culture, focus on what you need to
									grow as a leader so that others can follow suit.
									<br><br>
									Start by setting clear expectations for your team members about how you want them to behave. If
									something does happen that makes one of your team members uncomfortable, take a step back and see if
									there was anything about how you handled the situation that made them feel like they couldn't express
									themselves freely. Instead of becoming defensive when confronted about it, ask yourself: What can I do
									differently next time? Be mindful of who may be watching and keep them in mind when making decisions.
									Ultimately, your goal should be to make sure that everyone feels supported and accepted in the
									workplace. Creating a culture of safety will lead to increased creativity, innovation, retention rates
									and better morale.
									<br><br>
									The most important thing leaders can do is help others grow and become comfortable expressing ideas.
									Empowering individuals will ensure that your organization flourishes.

								<h2>Healthy feedback makes or breaks the culture</h2>
								<p>Leadership involves setting the tone for a company or organization. If you want to create a positive,
									productive culture, then you need to be open to hearing feedback-both the good and the bad. Leaders
									who are willing to listen to constructive criticism and make changes based on that feedback will help
									foster a healthy workplace culture. On the other hand, leaders who ignore feedback or become defensive
									when confronted with it will only damage morale and create an environment of fear and mistrust. Some
									people may not like your decisions but they should respect your right to make them. Healthy feedback
									makes or breaks the culture: Leadership involves setting the tone for a company or organization.</p>
